# Refactored Umbrella Architecture in Python

This repository contains a sample Python project that demonstrates a refactored, umbrella-style architecture. The project is structured into independent modules responsible for database operations, network communications, business logic processing, and presentation. This modular design promotes maintainability, testability, and easy extensibility.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Each module is responsible for a specific concern:
  - **DBModule**: Simulates a database with basic CRUD operations.
  - **NetworkModule**: Simulates network calls such as fetching, posting, and updating remote data.
  - **UseCaseModule**: Integrates database and network operations, processes data, and synchronizes changes.
  - **ViewModelModule**: Handles presentation logic and user interaction.
- **Dependency Injection**: Modules are wired together via manual dependency injection.
- **Simulation of Real-World Operations**: Combines local data with remote API data to showcase a complete workflow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/umbrella-architecture.git
   cd umbrella-architecture
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **No Additional Dependencies Required:**  
   This example is self-contained and does not require any external packages.

### Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will perform a series of operations:
- Display the initial combined data.
- Add a new record to the database.
- Update a record locally and remotely.
- Sync local data with the simulated network.
- Delete a record from the database.

## Module Overview

- **DBModule**:  
  Provides methods for:
  - Retrieving all records.
  - Adding, updating, and deleting records.

- **NetworkModule**:  
  Simulates network operations with functions to:
  - Fetch data from an API.
  - Post data to a remote server.
  - Update remote records.

- **UseCaseModule**:  
  Implements business logic to:
  - Combine data from the local database and network.
  - Sync data by posting combined records.
  - Update records both locally and remotely.

- **ViewModelModule**:  
  Handles presentation and user interaction by:
  - Displaying summaries and combined data.
  - Showing results of sync and update operations.
